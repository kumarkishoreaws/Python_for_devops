#identity operators
#Identity operators are used to compare two objects to check if they are the same object in memory.

a = 5
b = 6

res = a is b
print(res)



# Logical operators only work on boolen values 

a = True
b = False

res = a and b
print(res)

#o/p False. only if true and true makes the result true or else it will be false


# in → checks if an element is present in a list
